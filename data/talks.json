    "longDescription": "The Parable of the Parser by Ross Girshick, is a reflective talk from CVPR 2024 that discusses the evolution of NLP and computer vision. It examines the shift from classical parsing-based approaches in NLP to the dominance of LLMs, emphasizing that text generation has become the primary goal. The talk draws parallels to computer vision, questioning what the equivalent of parsers are in CV and advocating for a shift toward real-world, open-ended visual tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and embodied vision.",
